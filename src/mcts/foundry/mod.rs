//! QUARTZ Idea Foundry experimental contracts.
//!
//! The parent module exposes this tree only under Cargo feature
//! `idea-foundry`.  Enabling the feature compiles contracts and tests; it does
//! not install a coordinator into the production MCTS loop.  Experiment code
//! must explicitly construct `FoundryCoordinator` and a guarded executor.
